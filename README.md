# datavisualisation

Visualise 2 sets of data in 3 different ways, controlling variables with the pitch of the device. The first vertical data set is the raw angle data of device pitch and the second is based on 25 years of NASA climate data from 1993 to 2018, correlating average global temperatures, CO2 emmisions and sea level rises.

Using CoreMotion to dynamically draw different visuals in different views.
